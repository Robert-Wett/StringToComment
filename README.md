# String to Comment
## Purpose:
I find myself constantly copy+pasting comments/info into my python scripts, then manually formatting them (well, I start a macro with '10Wi\<enter\>'). I'd like to just highlight the string I want to convert to comments, press a command, and let it do it.

Sure, you can take a string and comment it no problem, but as far as I know there doesn't exist a plugin that will split the lines based on a defined character count, like an 80 char limit via PEP (python)
